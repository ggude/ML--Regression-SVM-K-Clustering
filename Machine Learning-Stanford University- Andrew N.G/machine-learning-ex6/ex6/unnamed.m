%  Since the model we are training is a linear SVM, we can inspect the
%  weights learned by the model to understand better how it is determining
%  whether an email is spam or not. The following code finds the words with
%  the highest weights in the classifier. Informally, the classifier
%  'thinks' that these words are the most likely indicators of spam.
%

% Sort the weights and obtin the vocabulary list
[weight, idx] = sort(model.w, 'descend');
vocabList = getVocabList();

fprintf('\nTop predictors of spam: \n');
for i = 1:15
    fprintf(' %-15s (%f) \n', vocabList{idx(i)}, weight(i));
end

fprintf('\n\n');
fprintf('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;

%% =================== Part 6: Try Your Own Emails =====================
%  Now that you've trained the spam classifier, you can use it on your own
%  emails! In the starter code, we have included spamSample1.txt,
%  spamSample2.txt, emailSample1.txt and emailSample2.txt as examples. 
%  The following code reads in one of these emails and then uses your 
%  learned SVM classifier to determine whether the email is Spam or 
%  Not Spam

% Set the file to be read in (change this to spamSample2.txt,
% emailSample1.txt or emailSample2.txt to see different predictions on
% different emails types). Try your own emails as well!
filename = 'spamSample1.txt';

% Read and predict
file_contents = readFile(filename);
word_indices  = processEmail(file_contents);
x             = emailFeatures(word_indices);
p = svmPredict(model, x);

fprintf('\nProcessed %s\n\nSpam Classification: %d\n', filename, p);
fprintf('(1 indicates spam, 0 indicates not spam)\n\n');
